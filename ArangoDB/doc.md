## Explanation

- version: This specifies the docker-compose version used (adjust if needed).
- services: This defines the services to be run.
  - arangodb: This service runs the ArangoDB container.
    - image: Specifies the ArangoDB image to use. You can use `latest` for the newest version or a specific version number.
    - environment: Sets the ArangoDB root password. Replace `your_strong_password` with a strong password.
    - ports: Exposes the ArangoDB port (default 8529) to the host machine.
    - volumes: Defines persistent volumes for data and applications.
      - arangodb_data: This volume stores ArangoDB's data directory (`/var/lib/arangodb3`).
      - arangodb_apps: This volume (optional) stores application data (`/var/lib/arangodb3-apps`).
- volumes: This section defines the persistent volumes referenced in the service.

## Points to Consider

- Replace `your_strong_password` with a secure password.
- Adjust the exposed port (8529) if needed.
- The `arangodb_apps` volume is optional for persisting application data.
- You can customize environment variables for further configuration (refer to ArangoDB documentation for details).

This configuration provides a basic setup for running ArangoDB with Docker Compose. Remember to adjust it based on your specific needs and refer to the ArangoDB documentation for further configuration options.
